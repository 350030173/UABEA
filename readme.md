## uabe avalonia

uabe remade in c# with avalonia.

uabea is still missing a lot of features and has lots of bugs, so unless your game is unity 2019.3+, please use the original uabe for now.

supported unity versions: **5 - 2020.2**

todo (basically everything)

* any error checking
* add / remove assets
* asset list searching
* ~~dependency loading (including data view)~~
* monobehaviour deserialization in data view
* ~~everything bundles (packing, importing, etc)~~
* ~~plugin support~~ and plugins themselves
  * ~~texture plugin~~
  * text asset plugin
  * audio plugin?
  * mesh plugin?
* implement the features that are going to be in [new uabe](https://community.7daystodie.com/topic/1871-unity-assets-bundle-extractor/?do=findComment&comment=357397)
