## uabe avalonia

uabe remade in c# with avalonia for newer versions of unity.

uabea is still missing a lot of features and has lots of bugs, so unless your game is unity 2019.3+, please use the original uabe for now.

supported unity versions: **5 - 2020.2**

[latest build](https://nightly.link/nesrak1/UABEA/workflows/dotnet-desktop/master/uabea-windows.zip) (newer but potentially unstable)
[latest release](https://github.com/nesrak1/UABEA/releases) (older and potentially missing bug fixes)
